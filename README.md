### Useful resources

- [BEM methodology](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/) - This helps me to know where exactly I'm working on so I don't have to create classes with some weird names haha.
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This file makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
- [HTML minifier](https://codebeautify.org/minify-html) - This page helps to have all your html document written in a single line.
- [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.org/) - This page helps to have all your css document written in a single line.
